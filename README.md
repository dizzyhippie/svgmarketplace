# svgmarketplace

This project was to create an Icon Marketplace with some CSS and JS components worked in for some interactivity. I had some trouble selecting the svgs with ID tags and had to work with their class names instead. I am unsure if this is uploaded properly, I have submitted my working files as well just in case.
